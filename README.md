# Prediction of Cirrhosis Outcomes

## Overview
This repository contains my solution for the [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e26/overview) aimed at predicting the outcomes of patients with liver cirrhosis. I placed in the top 15%.

## Data Description
The dataset used in this project consists of 17 clinical features (e.g. such as age, sex, cholesterol levels). The outcomes are categorized as follows: 0 = D (death), 1 = C (censored), and 2 = CL (censored due to liver transplantation). The full data description can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/cirrhosis-patient-survival-prediction).

## Project Structure


## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Baseline Results
3. Data Augmentation
4. Modeling
5. Representation Learning

## Lessons
- Ensembling generally helps performance
- Representation learning has the potential to increase performance at the cost of interpretability. However, it requires a lot of data.
